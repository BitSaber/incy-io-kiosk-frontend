# Kiosk Frontend

This repository holds the open source code for a Kiosk frontend application.

## How do I get set up?

To start, you need to have `yarn` installed. This can be done according to [yarn installation guide](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install). When this is done, install the dependencies needed for developing this project by running `yarn install`. After this, you should be able to run `yarn start`, and navigage to [the dev server running on port 3000](http://localhost:3000).
In case you are running your browser from a different computer than you are running `yarn` from, please use the IP or hostname of the computer running yarn instead of localhost. But if you are doing this, you probably understand this guide.

When hopping different branches, it might be a good idea to run `rm -rf node_modules && yarn install` to have a clean set of dependencies.
